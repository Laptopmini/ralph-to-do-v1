# ralph-html

A fork of [ralph-node](https://github.com/Laptopmini/ralph-node) with a simple boilerplate to serve a static HTML based application.

Fork this repo and drop in a new `PRD.md` to start building something with the loop already bootstrapped.

For full documentation on how the Ralph Loop works and how to use these repos, see the [original ralph-node README](https://github.com/Laptopmini/ralph-node#readme).
